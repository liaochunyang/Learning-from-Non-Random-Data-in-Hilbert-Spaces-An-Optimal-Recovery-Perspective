# Learning-from-Non-Random-Data-in-Hilbert-Spaces-An-Optimal-Recovery-Perspective
Numerical illustration for paper: Learning from Non-Random Data in Hilbert Spaces: An Optimal Recovery Perspective. Joint work with Simon Foucart, Shahin Shahrampour and Yinsong Wang.

Data Set: Energy.xlsx. There is another dataset year prediction. Please contact me if you need it, it's too large to upload.
Worst case error: Section VA is for worst case error illustration.
Test error: Section_VB_Energy and Section_VB_Year are for numerical illustration for test error on two different data sets.
